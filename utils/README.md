In order to build the tools necessary to run spike, run the .sh files in the following order:

1. build-rvv-toolchain.sh
2. build-spike.sh
3. build-pk.sh

Detailed instructions on how to properly run each script are located in their respective .sh files.

In the case that pk doesn't work via installation from the .sh file, the executeable file can be used instead as found in the /pk/riscv32/bin folder.
